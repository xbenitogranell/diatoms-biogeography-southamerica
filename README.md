# diatoms-biogeography-southamerica
Tropical South American Diatom Database

This repository contains a georeferenced inventory of diatom sites from tropical South America. 
The [database](http://www.xavierbenito.com/bgsa/bgsa.html) includes diatom (unicelular siliceous algae) data and associated environmental variables of waterbody sites (streams, wetlands, lakes), covering an altitudinal gradient from 220 to 5,070 m a.s.l. between 8°N–30°S and 58–79°W.

Datasets are mostly available on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.ck7pt) while here the aim is to provide a [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) map and [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app to interactively explore the database in R for promoting biodiversity, biogeographic and palaeoecological studies in tropical South America using diatoms as sentinel organisms.

Code adapted from [Simon Goring's](https://github.com/SimonGoring/ShinyLeaflet-tutorial) tutorial.
